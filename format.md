# Format

Sometimes its the best. You start over the relationship with your Mac and this time it will be better. 

First thing you should do is to follow a *format checklist*.

I always think to myself if I'm forgeting something when I'm formatting. To avoid that, here's a nice pretty format checklist with everything a developer (can) backup.

* **Documents and Files:**
    *  `~/Documents`
    *  `~/Pictures`
    *  `~/Music`
    *  `~/Downloads` - *I usually clean this folder beforehand*
    *  `~/Dropbox` - *optional*
    *  `~/Library/` - *I usually backup the whole folder and over time copy settings from it.*
*  **Applications:**
    *  No need to backup all the applications, just keep a file with the apps you are currently using. Run this bash comand to get a txt with all the apps you have:
    ```shell
    $ ls ~/Applications > ~/Desktop/apps.txt
    ```

    *  If you manage any "legal" software, you might want to backup those patchers. I keep all of those in a folder in *Downloads*.
