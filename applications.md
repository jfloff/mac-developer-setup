# Applications



### Productivity 
* **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/)**: even though Safari is getting better, it still doesn't beat Chrome. The centralization of bookmarks, addons, history, and all other things keeps thing simple and organized. Not to mention the amazing developer tools Chrome has.
* **[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)**: replacement for Spotligh. And even tough Yosemite brought spotlight to another level, I still can't live without my Alfred shortcuts.
* **[The Unarchiver](https://itunes.apple.com/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12)**: the all-in-one compress/uncompress app.

### Developer Tools
* **[Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html)**: Little Snitch informs you whenever a program attempts to establish an outgoing Internet connection. This reliably prevents private data from being sent out without your knowledge.
