# Applications



### Productivity
* **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/)**: even though Safari is getting better, it still doesn't beat Chrome. The centralization of bookmarks, addons, history, and all other things keeps thing simple and organized. Not to mention the amazing developer tools Chrome has.
* **[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)**: replacement for Spotlight. And even tough Yosemite brought Spotlight to another level, I still can't live without my Alfred shortcuts.
* **[The Unarchiver](https://itunes.apple.com/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12)**: the all-in-one compress/uncompress app.



### Developer Tools
* **[XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)**: Xcode provides everything developers need to create applications for Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

### Office
* **[Keynote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id409183694?mt=12&ls=1), [Numbers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numbers/id409203825?mt=12&ls=1) and [Pages](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id409201541?mt=12&ls=1)**: the Apple office suite. Oh, it's free!
