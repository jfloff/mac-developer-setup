Yes, I will give them all ... And if you want more, checkout ***Homebrew*** chapter ;)

### Productivity
* **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/)**: even though Safari is getting better, it still doesn't beat Chrome. The centralization of bookmarks, addons, history, and all other things keeps thing simple and organized. Not to mention the amazing developer tools Chrome has.
* **[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)**: replacement for Spotlight. And even tough Yosemite brought Spotlight to another level, I still can't live without my Alfred shortcuts.
* **[The Unarchiver](https://itunes.apple.com/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12)**: the all-in-one compress/uncompress app.
* **[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/downloading?os=mac)**: You know, it's Dropbox.
* **[Tuxera NTFS](http://www.tuxera.com/products/tuxera-ntfs-for-mac/)**: Full read-write compatibility with NTFS-formatted drives on a Mac. I've tried other alternatives but Tuxera its the only one that works for me.


### Developer Tools
* **[XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)**: Xcode provides everything developers need to create applications for Mac, iPhone, and iPad.
* **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**: Atom is Github take on text editors. It's main features is the extensibility of its core, and that's why I intend to use it more from now on.
* **[Sublime Text](www.sublimetext.com/3)**: Even tough I will be using Atom, I still recomend Sublime Text. It's still the best editor, and if you don't want all that Atom hacking, go for it.

### Office
* **[Keynote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id409183694?mt=12&ls=1), [Numbers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numbers/id409203825?mt=12&ls=1) and [Pages](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id409201541?mt=12&ls=1)**: the Apple office suite. Oh, it's free!

### Others
* **[Alinof Timer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alinof-timer/id512464723?mt=12)**: Alinof Timer is a very easy to use timer for your Mac.
* **[Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/)**: Torrent management done right.
* **[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)**: The best media player. Ever. Period.
* **[AppTrap](http://onnati.net/apptrap/)**: with AppTrap when you move an application to the trash, you're automatically asked if you want to move the associated preference files as well.
