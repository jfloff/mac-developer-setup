# Ruby

Before installing Ruby, we will install **[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)**. 

*rbenv* manages  the Ruby versions for your applications and guarantee that your development environment matches production. I know that *rvm* is a more popular pick on this subject, but [this rundown](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/wiki/Why-rbenv%3F) summarizes the good reasons to pick rbenv instead.

To install run:

```shell
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

Don't touch my *rubys* ...
