![](http://www.cinemablend.com/images/news/68902/_1419907845.gif)

So next time I will not forget anything, here's a nice pretty format checklist with everything a developer (can) backup.
* **Documents and Files:**
    *  ~/Documents
    *  ~/Pictures
    *  ~/Music
    *  ~/Downloads - *I usually clean this folder beforehand*
    *  ~/Dropbox - *optional*
*  **Settings:**
    *  ~/Library/ - *I usually backup the whole folder and over time copy settings from it.*
    *
