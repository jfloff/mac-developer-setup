# Format Checklist

![](http://www.cinemablend.com/images/news/68902/_1419907845.gif)

So next time I will not forget anything, here's a nice pretty format checklist with everything a developer (can) backup.
* **Documents and Files:**
    *  ~/Documents
    *  ~/Pictures
    *  ~/Music
    *  ~/Downloads - *I usually clean this folder beforehand*
    *  ~/Dropbox - *optional*
    *  ~/Library/ - *I usually backup the whole folder and over time copy settings from it.*
*  **Applications:**
    *  No need to backup all the applications, just keep a file with the apps you are currently using. Run this bash comand to get a txt with all the apps you have:
    ```shell
    $ ls ~/Applications > ~/Desktop/apps.txt
    ```

    *  If you manage any "legal" software, you might want to backup those patchers. I keep all of those in a folder in *Downloads*.
    *
