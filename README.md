# Mac Setup for the Middle Earth Developer

Why do I do this stuff? Each fresh install I do, I face the exact same problems I had the last time. Why I'm not that organized developer that keeps track of all the little tips and tricks he learns along the way? I bet that this fresh install would be that much easier ...

Well, I guess I should start this: Dear Middle Earth, this is my attempt at being an organized developer. Please hang with me.

This book will cover the basics of setting up a development environment on a fresh Mac OSX Yosemite install. It is my intent that this book serves as a reference for everyone when installing some language/library.

All contributions to the book are welcome. Please help add support for other libraries and languages.
