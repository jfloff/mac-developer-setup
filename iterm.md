# iTerm

If you're still using Terminal, stop it. Right now. Just close it, remove the shortcuts and do yourself a favour: install **iTerm2**. Future you will thank both you and me.

Now on to some cool settings

####Open tab/pane with current working directory
Under **Profiles** tab, go to **General** subtab, set **Working Directory** to *“Reuse previous session’s directory”.

#### System-wide hotkey to toggle iTerm2
Under **Keys** tab, in **Hotkey** section, enable *“Show/hide iTerm2 with a system-wide hotkey”* and input your hotkey combination, e.g. I use ```Ctrl + Shift + L```.

#### Switch pane with mouse cursor
Under **Pointer**, in **Miscellaneous Settings** section, enable *“Focus follows mouse”*.

#### Colors and Font Settings

* Download the **[Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)** font, and change the iTerm font to the Source Code Pro Lite 14pt.
* Download the **[Solarized dark](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/iterm2-colors-solarized)** iTerm colors from here. And then set these to your default profile colors.
